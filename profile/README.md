## What we do
[Sunhat](https://www.getsunhat.com/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral) is an automation-focused software company founded to rethink sustainability compliance from the ground up. At Sunhat, we strongly believe in the vision that sustainability should be a base level for all products and services that everyone can rely on. This involves not only complying with outside sustainability requirements, but also taking the verification of underlying data to a new level.

Thatâ€™s why our team of software, sustainability and compliance experts has created an all-in-one platform to help companies automate and scale their sustainability programs, built to meet both outside requirements and each companyâ€™s very own sustainability standards. 

We are proud to support mission-driven companies all over the world in building continuous sustainability programs and taking sustainability compliance to the next level!
