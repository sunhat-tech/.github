# Hey there, you made it to the Sunhat GitHub page ðŸŽ‰

## What we do
We are a German SaaS Start-up in stealth mode that enables companies to streamline sustainability compliance in order to build trust and drive business in shorter time. Sunhat helps teams to answer sustainability specific requests faster and more efficiently (external requests from customers & investors + internal requests from other departments).

## Why you should work with us

We are a highly motivated, experienced and diverse team at the very start of our journey to build something meaningful. We are backed by experienced VCs and entrepreneurs from the tech and sustainability space. This is your chance to join us and get in on the ground floor of this journey!

Here are some things to know about us:

- We are not a consultancy - we are building a SaaS product for users with a real problem.
- We use modern technologies and providers which accelerate the development of Sunhat
- We are not building behind closed curtains: done is better than perfect
- We aim for scaling but we also recognize when we should do things that don't scale
- We care for accessibility as a core aspect of Sunhat
- We strive for a high degree of automation and testing
